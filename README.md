# AC-DC-Drivers
This repository documents coursework and practical projects focused on motor control systems. The course introduces fundamental concepts and hands-on practices across three core domains: electromechanical systems, driver circuits, and microcontroller programming.

### ðŸ§° Hardware & Tools
- **Microcontroller** : Texas Instruments **F28379D LaunchPad**
- **Simulation Software** : **MATLAB / Simulink**
- **Programming Language** : Embedded **C**
- **IDE** : Code Composer Studio (CCS)

### ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
- Understand and apply motor control concepts including:
  - PWM, SVPWM, Six-Step Commutation, FOC
  - ADC sampling, timer configuration, drive tables
  - Coordinate transformation (Clarke/Park)
- Combine simulation and real-time control
- Develop firmware on TI's C2000 platform
- Practice structured embedded system development

### Midterm_Project_Six_Step_Square_Wave

- Implements **six-step commutation** (square wave drive) for BLDC motors.
- Control logic based on Hall sensor feedback.
- Includes waveform capture and testing.

## Final_Project_FOC

- Full implementation of **Field-Oriented Control (FOC)** using F28379D.
- Current and speed control loop in Simulink.
- Real-time signal capture (PWM, current, position).
